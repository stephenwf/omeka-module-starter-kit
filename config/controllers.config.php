/**
 * Controllers
 *
 * There are a few ways to perform DI for controllers. The two most common to use will
 * be typical container injection as below, where the closure receives the container
 * and returns your dependency.
 *
 * Other ways include:
 *
 * Invokable factory:
 * [ MyNonConstructableController::class => \Zend\ServiceManager\Factory\InvokableFactory::class ]
 *
 * This method is shorter and useful for controllers without dependencies.
 *
 * Full factory:
 * [ MyNonConstructableController::class => MyCustomFactory::class ]
 *
 * This is a fully formed factory where the class MyCustomFactory contains an __invoke() method
 * that receives the container much like the closure. The difference being it can be a service
 * itself and constructed separately, allowing for greater control of how the chain of dependencies
 * is managed. For example, a 3rd party could construct a Factory that is used in multiple places
 * and leverage full control of how the dependencies are created.
